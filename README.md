# Nick's .NET Backend Developer Roadmap for 2022

Hey there ðŸ‘‹. This is my (very opinionated) roadmap for .NET developers that want to focus on backend and specifically work with microservices. If you want a more generic ASP.NET Developer Roadmap, you can check out the one that inspired this one [here](https://github.com/MoienTajik/AspNetCore-Developer-Roadmap).

In cases where I used cloud specific technology, like Azure Cosmos DB and AWS DynamoDB, you can assume that I also included the equivalent tech from other cloud providers like GCP.

I will try to keep updating this roadmap as the technology landscape is evolving.
